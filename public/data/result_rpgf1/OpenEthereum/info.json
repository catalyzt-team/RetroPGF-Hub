{"name":"OpenEthereum","website":"https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum","lead_name":"Unmaintained","email":"n/a","question_1":"OpenEthereum runs the Kovan testnet which many projects use. Its unclear if Erigon will be able to run Kovan by the time of the next hardfork that will be delaying the difficulty bomb. It would be useful for some funds to be used to implement the next hardfork in OpenEthereum to buy more time for Erigon to take over the Kovan testnet. See https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/arrow-glacier.md for information about the next hardfork","allocation":"$13,447"}
