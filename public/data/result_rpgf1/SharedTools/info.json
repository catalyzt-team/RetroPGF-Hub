They also provide vote Escrow UI among other fantastic tools. Other pros include:\n\n- UI for those who don't want to use scripts to deploy contracts\n- Easy to follow controls\n- Opens up the opportunity to write smart contract to a wider public\n- Active development on OVM implementations\n- A little bit of love might help the devs develop this into a full-scale mainnet tool as well.","allocation":"-"}
