This is an extremely important test suite for possible future client implementors to check behaviour/spec conformance and is an important component of the ethereum CI pipeline, results can be viewed here: https://hivetests.ethdevops.io/. Hive will likely also be repurposed to support eth2 in the future.","allocation":"$31,785"}
