{"name":"TrueBlocks","website":"http://trueblocks.io","lead_name":"Thomas Jay Rush (self-nominating)","email":"jrush@quickblocks.io","question_1":"We've been working since early 2016 on the same mission. To truly decentralize access to on chain data in a way that avoids all the obvious downsides of web 2.0 APIs (which is basically the only way people access on chain data today). We've made amazing progress perhaps best described here https://unchainedindex.io, however if you read our blog posts and white papers here (https://trueblocks.io/) you'll learn a lot about us as well. We've devised a way to build an index of \"every appearance of every address as it appears anywhere on the Ethereum mainnet.\" Furthermore, we've figured out how to share that index to end users in a fair and equitable way where each user carries his/her own burden and shares that burden with others through IPFS. This allows us to create a local-first desktop application that can do 18-decimal place, every-14-second, fully-reconciled accounting on any address. Here's a picture of what that might look like: https://twitter.com/trueblocks/status/1445511417017163784. Sorry if this is a self-nomination, and if this violates the rules, please excuse me and feel free to ignore.","allocation":"$12,225"}
