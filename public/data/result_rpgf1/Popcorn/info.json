{"name":"Popcorn","website":"https://popcorn.network/","lead_name":"Anthony Daniel Martin","email":"anthony@popcorn.network","question_1":"Popcorn takes fees earned from DeFi and redirects it to non-profits through decentralized governance. The groundwork has been laid for public goods funding to be baked into the foundation of DeFi protocols without introducing any additional friction or extraordinary cost to the end user. As it is distributing rewards via on-chain decentralized governance, Optimism is an ideal solution to reduce fees and promote community participation. Thus, I believe that retroPGF will help Popcorn achieve its vision of long-term, sustainable public benefit through DeFi.\n\nGithub link: https://github.com/popcorndao/workspace","allocation":"-"}
