The EthernautDAO has a lot of plans for the near future, and would certainly enjoy a bit of community recognition and help. Our goal is to transform web2 devs into web3 devs in a mere instant, and grow the Ethereum dev community by aligning incentives in a gamified way. We've  trained about a dozen devs so far with zero resources, and have even succeeded in getting most of them hired by web3 teams. We need some help  to scale this process exponentially.","allocation":"$14,670"}
