      RetroPGF Rounds 1 & 2 were a resounding success, benefitting numerous
      dedicated individuals and teams who are passionate about creating public
      goods. These retroactive grants have not only made a significant impact on
      their projects but have also reinforced their commitment to the Optimism
      ecosystem. At the heart of the Optimism Collective's mission is the belief
      that those who contribute to public goods should be rewarded for their
      efforts. RetroPGF is like a refreshing twist on the traditional market
      economy, specifically designed to champion public goods. And the best
      part? It's already proving to be a game-changer for many builders within
      the Collective. RetroPGF, in essence, serves as Optimism's vehicle for
      nurturing the development of a free, open, and decentralized internet that
      puts the power and value back into the hands of those who create and
      maintain it.
