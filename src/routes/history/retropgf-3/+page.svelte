      RetroPGF Rounds 1 & 2 were a resounding success, benefitting numerous
      dedicated individuals and teams who are passionate about creating public
      goods. These retroactive grants have not only made a significant impact on
      their projects but have also reinforced their commitment to the Optimism
      ecosystem. At the heart of the Optimism Collective's mission is the belief
      that those who contribute to public goods should be rewarded for their
      efforts. RetroPGF is like a refreshing twist on the traditional market
      economy, specifically designed to champion public goods. And the best
      part? It's already proving to be a game-changer for many builders within
      the Collective. RetroPGF, in essence, serves as Optimism's vehicle for
      nurturing the development of a free, open, and decentralized internet that
      puts the power and value back into the hands of those who create and
      maintain it.

      <div>
        Ever wondered how we can accurately assess the impact and profitability
        of all the amazing projects nominated for Retroactive Public Goods
        Funding (RetroPGF)? It's a big task, and no single badgeholder can have
        all the answers. But fret not, because we have a plan to make it happen!
        In previous rounds, we've seen badgeholders sharing their project
        evaluations with each other. Now, in Round 3, we're taking it up a
        notch. We're introducing a cool new feature called "Lists."
      </div>
      <div
        class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center max-h-[60em] my-5 overflow-hidden"

          alt="Lists"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        Think of Lists as a super flexible way to collaborate and delegate. Each
        List consists of a group of projects carefully chosen from the pool of
        RetroPGF applicants. Not only that, but it also comes with a suggested
        allocation of OP token for each project.
      </div>
      <ol class="list-disc ml-5 my-5">
        <li>
          <div class="font-medium">Knowledge Sharing</div>
          <div class="text-gray-600">
            Lists are all about sharing knowledge. Since no one can be an expert
            on everything, Lists allow badgeholders to bring their unique
            insights and expertise to the table within specific areas.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="font-medium">Collaboration Made Easy</div>
          <div class="text-gray-600">
            With Lists, badgeholders can easily share their project evaluations
            with others. You can replicate or tweak someone else's votes if you
            find their approach appealing.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="font-medium">Methodology Matters</div>
          <div class="text-gray-600">
            Each List creator provides a methodology for distributing OP to each
            project based on their expertise and data evaluation. It adds
            transparency and trust to the process.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div>
        Lists empower badgeholders to tap into each other's expertise when
        making their own voting decisions. It's a step toward transitioning from
        subjective reviews to standardized impact evaluation frameworks. We
        believe that Lists will become an invaluable tool for badgeholders to
        collaborate and leverage each other's strengths. Our bet is that this
        will lead to badgeholders supporting more projects than ever before.
      </div>
      <div class="text-lg font-semibold my-4">Impact Evaluation</div>
      <div>
        Retroactive Funding is a pretty new and exciting concept in the world of
        grant funding. It flips the script by rewarding projects for the
        positive impact they've already made, rather than guessing at their
        future contributions.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-3">
        In Round 3, we're all about providing badgeholders with a clearer
        roadmap for evaluating impact:
      </div>
      <ol class="list-disc ml-5 my-5">
        <li>
          <div class="font-medium">Clearer Roles</div>
          <div class="text-gray-600">
            We're giving badgeholders a more defined role. Instead of just
            sharing personal preferences or experiences, they're stepping into
            the shoes of impact and profit judges. It's all about assessing the
            real impact a project has had.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="font-medium">Impact Evaluation Frameworks</div>
          <div class="text-gray-600">
            We're not leaving badgeholders in the dark. We're working together
            to create frameworks that help us nail down what impact really
            means. This isn't a solo effort; it's a team endeavor with
            badgeholders playing a crucial role.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div>
        These changes benefit everyone. Badgeholders get a better understanding
        of what they're voting for, and projects get a clearer picture of what
        they'll be rewarded for. It's a win-win! But here's the thing, defining
        impact and building these frameworks is an ongoing journey. Round 3 is
        just the beginning of our mission to establish a shared understanding of
        impact assessment.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-3">
        Our guess? With these frameworks in place, badgeholders will find more
        common ground and vote in a way that makes sense to everyone. Let's
        build a more united and impactful RetroPGF together!

        At RetroPGF, we're all about making the voting process smoother and more
        enjoyable for our valued badgeholders. We've learned from past rounds
        and are excited to introduce some exciting changes in Round 3.

            We get it, reviewing dozens or even hundreds of projects can be
            overwhelming. That's why we've designed a single application that
            lets badgeholders review projects, check out Lists, allocate their
            votes, and submit their choices‚Äîall in one place.

            Project profiles and applications are seamlessly integrated with
            additional tools. This simplifies the process and helps badgeholders
            make informed decisions.

            Our voting design is now perfectly in sync with the role of our
            badgeholders. It's designed to help them understand their
            responsibilities and vote accordingly.

          <div class="text-gray-600">
            Each badgeholder can allocate up to 30 million OP token across
            projects, but the beauty is that they can choose to use only a
            portion of their voting power if they wish. It's all about giving
            them flexibility.

            for more nuanced voting decisions.

        We believe these new voting applications will not only simplify the life
        of our badgeholders but also encourage them to vote in a way that aligns
        with RetroPGF's vision and goals. So, get ready for a more
        user-friendly, efficient, and exciting voting experience in Round 3.
        Let's make RetroPGF even better, one vote at a time!

              empower badgeholders to review and vote on projects. Plus, they're
              designing two different voting experiences, so badgeholders can
              choose what suits them best.
