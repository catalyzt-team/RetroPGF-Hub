      Welcome to RetroPGF Experiment #1, where we're pioneering a groundbreaking
      approach to funding public goods! We're excited to announce our commitment
      to donating $1 million of network profits in this inaugural experiment. At
      RetroPGF, we're all about leveling the playing field between profit-driven
      startups and nonprofit/open-source projects. Our goal is to provide the
      same benefits and incentives for those who contribute to the greater good
      of technology.

      <div class="flex justify-center mt-3">
        Our first experiment is focused on creating a fair and effective system
        for allocating funds to deserving projects. We understand that this
        process is challenging, and we're dedicated to refining it through
        multiple iterations. In this MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase, a group
        of 24 "badgeholders" will use quadratic voting to decide how to allocate
        the $1 million. These badge holders consist of 8 Optimists and 16
        members from the Ethereum community. The allocation process will
        primarily consider the value projects have contributed to the Optimistic
        Ethereum ecosystem.

        Over the next month, we invite the Optimistic Ethereum community to
        nominate projects that they believe should receive a portion of this
        funding. The 24 badgeholders will openly discuss these projects via a
        public, read-only Discord channel named <span class="italic"

          >
          <div class="text-gray-700">
            The Ethereum community expanded the definition of public goods,
            focusing on outcomes rather than strict economic characteristics.
            This shift led to projects like Etherscan, although not
            traditionally public goods, receiving support due to their
            contributions.

          <span class="font-medium">The Fairness Ratio</span>
          <div class="text-gray-700">
            The concept of value created vs. value captured (Value Created /
            Value Captured = 1) played a crucial role in allocation decisions.
            Projects like Etherscan, despite extracting value through ads, were
            considered to create more value than they captured.

            Many badge holders had affiliations or connections with nominated
            projects, raising questions about conflicts of interest. Strategies
            for badge holder voting were often influenced by their areas of
            expertise.

            The nomination process lacked detail, with proposals often failing
            to describe how the nominated project benefited the public good. A
            significant number of proposals were accepted.

            Implement a two-phase process for nominations, separating the
            identification of projects that contribute to the public good from
            quantifying their value. Use a token-curated registry model to
            curate high-quality nominees, reducing the burden on badge holders.

          <div class="text-gray-700">
            Instead of expecting a small group of badge holders to have
            expertise across the entire ecosystem, elect badge holders with
            strong knowledge in various areas. This approach ensures that
            expertise is leveraged to benefit the ecosystem effectively.

            Establish clear guidelines and increase transparency regarding
            conflicts of interest. Rules in the badge holder manual can forbid
            voting for one's own projects and require transparent disclosure of
            potential conflicts.
