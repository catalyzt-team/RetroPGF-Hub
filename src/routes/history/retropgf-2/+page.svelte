      The Citizens' House employs a unique approach called "retroactive public
      goods funding" (RetroPGF), which believes it's easier to support what's
      proven valuable rather than guessing what might be useful. Each RetroPGF
      round begins with a defined funding scope, initially set by the Optimism
      Foundation and later by the community. Projects are then evaluated by the
      Citizens' House based on their impact within this scope, determining
      funding allocations. Optimism is committed to dedicating 20% of its OP
      token allocation to RetroPGF, and future rounds will tap into additional
      funding sources. This iterative process blends theory, practice, and
      community feedback to shape a retroactive funding system that benefits
      all.

      <div class=" mt-2">
        The Optimism Collective recently held its second round of Retroactive
        Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) in the first quarter of 2023. The
        RetroPGF 2 allocation of 10 million OP tokens was directed towards
        funding public goods that promote the development and usage of the OP
        Stack. The ultimate goal of the Collective is to establish a global
        system that rewards positive contributions with individual profit. The
        RetroPGF mechanism serves as an experiment towards achieving this goal
        of <span class="font-medium">"impact = profit"</span>. By funding public
        goods in a sustainable manner, the Collective can foster a thriving
        ecosystem and a stronger economy. Overall, this initiative aims to
        create a positive impact on the world. The Optimism Collective believes
        that building public goods should be profitable.

        This is the kick-off for the project nominations of the recently
        announced RetroPGF Round 2. Optimism’s vision is to build a global
        system where positive impact to the Collective is rewarded by profit to
        the individual. RetroPGF is an experimental mechanism to realize this
        goal of “impact = profit”. For more information, read the announcement
