    "body": "**What is a Draft Project Idea?**\n\nA Draft Project Idea is a concept for a project within the Optimism ecosystem that is generally considered valuable but has not yet been fleshed out into a clearly defined product. Draft Project Ideas may be converted into Ecosystem Project Ideas as they are explored further and more thoroughly specified.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThe Impact Calculator is designed to streamline the evaluation of projects in the Optimism RetroPGF voting process by quantifying their impact through various metrics. This tool is expected to transition the grantmaking process from individual project evaluation to a more strategic overview, helping to maintain and improve the ROI of grant allocations.\nThe idea for this project is to built a simple prototype to test out the idea. \n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/assets/43515441/6bd16763-b586-466c-b4c1-41595af98411)\n\nYou can find a Figma mock up with some more detailed descriptions [here](https://www.figma.com/file/OS8DSbKyuiYPqcRTmmhTIM/Impact-Calculator-%F0%9F%8C%B1?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=4qGwi0ZEsvOMlxkF-1) \n\nDive deeper into impact vectors by checking out Carl's post on [levels of the game](https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/HikrWg-CneYoHruCON5gCi6BL7R71TEBpdJjgqon9M8) and [Ecosystem Impact Vectors](https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/qL9YKLN9-dBzM89qKaZYgHK2ccpZy2XLPz2Z1PObwCg), or play around with [OpenSource Observer](https://www.opensource.observer/).\n\nIf you're interesting in tackling this project idea, come [join this Telegram group\n](https://t.me/+B5likgTv8sk3MWVi)\n## Possible Features\n1. Impact Vector Selection: Allows users to choose from various impact vectors with descriptions and creator names, search functionality, and options to view detailed pages or add vectors to a ballot.\n2. Ballot View: A ballot system where users can select or deselect impact vectors and edit their configurations. This includes a graphical representation of the distribution of funds among projects.\n3. Detailed View: Each impact vector has a detailed view, including a name, description, creator, and a link to GitHub. Users can visualize the impact vector and configure it.\n4. Configuration Option: Users can set a scale or weight to deterimine how flat or skewed the eventual distribution of tokens to projects should be.",

Read more about Missions [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881)._\r\n\r\n* **S5 Intent**: Technical Decentralization\r\n* **Foundation Mission (RFP):** Host an open source user interface (UI) that allows users to move assets to/from Ethereum (L1) to any OP Chain (L2) in the Superhain (OP Mainnet, Base, PGN, Zora, Mode, etc.) via the [standard bridge](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/#) and OP Chain (L2) to OP Chain (L2) when interop is available.\r\n* **Proposal Tier:**  [Fledgling](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877) \r\n* **Baseline grant amount**: 200K OP\r\n* **Accepting one or multiple proposals:** Multiple \r\n* **OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Sponsor**: Zain (@zainbacchus)\r\n* **Submit by**: December 15th at 19:00 GMT\r\n* **Selection by**: December 29th at 19:00 GMT\r\n\r\n### **How will this Foundation Mission (RFP) will help accomplish the above Intent?**\r\n\r\nThis RFP introduces a Superchain Bridge interface which acts as the foundation for users to move tokens to / from any OP Chain in the Superchain using the canonical standard bridge in the OP Stack.\r\n\r\nOptimism is leaning on its ecosystem to bootstrap access to the protocol. Not running our own frontend increases censorship resistance and decentralization, but also helps us bootstrap a distributed ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAs such, this mission will contribute to a more resilient bridging ecosystem for the Superchain.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nThe Superchain Bridge Interface allows users to bridge to / from any OP Chain in the Superchain from L1 Ethereum using the [standard bridge](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/#). Once the [MVP of low latency L2 to L2 message passing](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/understand/explainer/#low-latency-l2-to-l2-message-passing) is live (est. mid 2024), the Superchain Bridge interface should also allow users to bridge between OP Chains.\r\n\r\nCompleting this RFP requires building an open source frontend that allows users to bridge to / from any OP Chain in the Superchain. The frontend should be fully open-source and should allow for future iterations of the functionality. This RFP requires both designs and implementation.\r\n \r\nFor this RFP, the Optimism Foundation will accept up to two submissions. Multiple frontends will maximize the likelihood of success and improve the resilience of the system.\r\n\r\nThe target grant reward for each submission will be 200k OP. Teams should discuss the solution criteria below with the Foundation, and may arrive at a different mutually agreeable grant amount dependent on the scope of their work.\r\n\r\n### **Solution Criteria:**\r\n\r\nCore functionality of the Superchain Bridge interface:\r\n\r\n**Wallet connection**\r\n- As a user I can use either an EOA or Smart Contract Wallet to deposit / withdraw from the bridge interface. The wallet connect should include but not limited to support browser injected wallets like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow Wallet, as well as WalletConnect v2 and smart contract wallets.\r\n\r\n**Token bridges**\r\n- As a user I can bridge from L1 to L2 Mainnets / Testnets for any OP Chain in the Superchain (e.g. OP, Base, PGN, Zora, Mode etc.)\r\n- As a user I can bridge from L2 to L2 Mainnets / Testnets for any OP Chain in the Superchain (e.g. OP, Base, PGN, Zora, Mode etc.)\r\n- As a user I can specify the destination address I want to transfer tokens to\r\n\r\n**Token lists**\r\n- As a user I can use my preferred token list to find which tokens I want to bridge. The token lists should include but should not be limited to the [Superchain Tokenlist](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/#the-superchain-token-list). \r\n- As a user I can bridge any arbitrary [standard ERC-20](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/#depositing-erc20s) using the bridge interface\r\n\r\n**3rd party bridges**\r\n- As a user I can find a list of supported 3rd party bridges when bridging to/from a non-Ethereum / OP Chain blockchain\r\n\r\n**Account history**\r\n- As a user I can view my deposits / withdrawals for any OP Chain in the Superchain (e.g. OP, Base, PGN, Zora, Mode etc.)\r\n- As a user I can initiate the two-step withdrawal process for any relevant withdraws\r\n\r\n**Query parameters** \r\n- As a user I can create a link that points to a specific network on the bridge (e.g. bridge.org/base)\r\n- As a user I can create a link that points to a specific token on a specific network on the bridge (e.g. bridge.org/base/USDC).\r\n\r\n**Block explorer**\r\n- As a User I can select my preferred block explorer for viewing transaction confirmation. This should include but not limited to support OnceUpon, Blockscout, and Etherscan (when available).\r\n\r\n**i18n**\r\n- As a user I can select my preferred language to interact with the bridge interface including but not limited to English (EN), Hindi (HI), Arabic (AR), German (DE), Spanish (ES), French (FS), Indonesian (ID), Japanese (JA), Vietnamese (VI), Chinese Simplified (ZH-CN), Chinese Traditional (ZH-TW), Korean (KO), Polish (PL), Portuguese (PT), and Thai (TH)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compliance**\r\nThe Superchain Bridge Interface should include an appropriate user legal agreement and risk disclosures, which will be subject to evaluation and confirmation by the Foundation.  The Superchain Bridge Interface should also implement appropriate compliance measures to prevent it from being used in violation of applicable laws. The compliance measures implemented by a grantee will be subject to evaluation and confirmation by the Foundation. Prior agreed compliance costs incurred by the grantee will be reimbursed by the Foundation for at least one year following launch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Superchain Registry**\r\nThe Superchain Bridge Interface should only include OP Chains in the Superchain and update to include new OP Chains as they come online. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe user interface must use the [Superchain Registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/tree/main/superchain/configs/mainnet) and relevant [CCTP bridges](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoin/docs/cctp-protocol-contract) to determine the canonical bridges that are supported. Furthermore, the UI should provide instructions for how the user can verify using their wallet that they are interacting with the canonical bridge for the respective OP Chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Service level agreement**\r\nThe bridge interface should continue to support adding new OP Chains as they come online. To ensure this happen, the RFP proposer must agree to a service level agreement that governs the ongoing maintenance, support, and enhancement of the Bridge UI, including but not limited to the addition of new operation chains, bug fixes, updates, and improvements as outlined in the RFP. Past the 1 year service agreement, through Optimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding, we expect interface maintainers will be rewarded based on the reliability of the interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **How should the Foundation measure progress towards this Foundation Mission (RFP)?** \r\n\r\nProgress can be measured based upon the completion of the following milestones:\r\n\r\n- Specification for implementation, design approach, and architecture for the functionality listed above.\r\n- Open-source code repository to observe progress over time\r\n- Launching Phase 1: L1 <> L2 bridging\r\n- Launching Phase 2: L2 <> L2 bridging\r\n- 1 year toll gate: Service level agreement for bridge has been hit \r\n\r\n\r\nThese milestones mark the completion of the proposal. \r\n\r\n## **How should RetroPGF badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n- Volume of bridging transactions (by distinct addresses / USD volume) that is triggered through this interface\r\n- Share of bridging transactions (by distinct addresses / USD volume) that is triggered through this interface compared to all other onramps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Application instructions\r\n\r\n_To apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread below.

This RFP aims to remedy this by expanding access to the Safe functionality and interface to all OP Chains thereby reducing developer and operator friction. \r\n\r\nThe scope of this RFP will be to introduce a Superchain [Safe interface](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-wallet-web) which acts as the foundation for users to use the [Safe functionality](https://github.com/safe-global) across all testnets and mainnets  in the Superchain\r\n\r\nAs such, this mission will contribute to a more resilient and secure developer ecosystem for the Superchain.\r\n\r\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nThe deployment (if required) of Safe Contracts (ex Gnosis Safe) and backend services for all mainnet and testnet OP Chains in the Superchain, and supporting Superchain Safe interface. \r\n\r\n### **Solution Criteria:**\r\n\r\nCore functionality of the Superchain Safe RFP include deployment (if required), backend services configuration (if required), Superchain Safe UI, and ongoing maintenance. \r\n\r\n**1. Deployment and configuration**: deploy Safe contracts (if required), and configure the latest Safe components on adequate infrastructure for 2 environments (Stage and Production)\r\n\r\n- Safe Contract deployments: As part of the RFP, we expect deterministic deployment of the collection of Safe contracts (https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts) on the following OP Chain mainnets and testnets: Zora, Public Goods Network, Mode, Lyra, Orderly, and Ancient8 as well as any future OP Stack Chain (total of 10 deployments).

This RFP requires both designs and implementation.\r\n, \r\nFor this RFP, the Optimism Foundation will accept one submission.\r\n\r\nThe target grant reward for the submission will be 30K OP. Teams should discuss the solution criteria below with the Foundation, and may arrive at a different mutually agreeable grant amount dependent on the scope of their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Solution Criteria:**\r\n\r\nCore functionality of the claim experience includes both a flow for event maintainers and an end user flow. \r\n\r\n**Proposed maintainer flow**\r\nTo set up the claim experience, the event maintainer should require minimal setup.\r\n- Maintainer sets up a new event using an admin portal\r\n- Maintainer is provided a URL to use for the specific in person events\r\n- Maintainer sets up the URL at the respective event\r\n\r\n**Proposed end user flow**\r\nTo claim the proof of attendance attestation the flow should be sybil-resistant, gasless, and allows the user to specify their preferred address. \r\n- Developers come to the OP booth \r\n- Developer scans the QR code or URL at the OP booth\r\n- Developer completes challenge that proves they’re at the booth (eg by entering a unique code)\r\n- Developer enters their wallet address or ENS name\r\n- Developer gets a proof of attendance attestation and Optimist NFT minted to their specified address \r\n- Developer is prompted use the faucet to get larger drips from the faucet or customize their Optimist NFT\r\n\r\n**Ethereum attestation service (EAS) and Optimist NFT**\r\n[EAS](https://docs.optimism.io/identity/contracts-eas) is an open-source public good that is included as a predeploy in the OP Stack. The proof of attendance attestations should use the EAS contracts on OP Mainnet and requires a new schema for the proof of attendance attestations to be created. \r\n\r\n[The Optimist NFT](https://app.optimism.io/optimist-nft) is a fully customizable digital avatar that allows you to showcase your personality and build your onchain identity. \r\n\r\n\r\nProposed implementation of proof of attestation / auto-minting the Optimist NFT:\r\n- Create an [EAS resolver](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/resolver-contracts) that restricts ability to create this attestation to specific addresses\r\n- This resolver should maintain a mapping(address => bool) of everyone who currently has this attestation using the onAttest and onRevoke hooks\r\n- Update [OptimistAllowlist](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/periphery/op-nft/OptimistAllowlist.sol).sol to check the resolver contract to see if user is eligible\r\n- Auto-mint feature: Automatically mint the Optimist NFT to users who have the proof of attendance attestation\r\n  - Option 1: The resolver should do the above, then directly mint the NFT\r\n  - Option 2: Use multicall3 to 1. Create the attestation, 2. Use `function mint(address _recipient)` function on [OptimistNFT](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/periphery/op-nft/Optimist.sol) in a single transaction\r\n\r\n### **How should the Foundation measure progress towards this Foundation Mission (RFP)?** \r\n\r\nProgress can be measured based upon the completion of the following milestones:\r\n\r\n- Specification for implementation, design approach, and architecture for the functionality listed above.\r\n- Open-source code repository to observe progress over time\r\n- Launch of the interface\r\n\r\nThese milestones mark the completion of the proposal. \r\n\r\n## **How should RetroPGF badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n- Number of attestations (by distinct addresses) that is triggered through this interface\r\n- Number of contracts deployed on OP Chain testnets by addresses that have attestations from this interface\r\n\r\n\r\n## Application instructions\r\n\r\n_To apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread below.

    "body": "## Foundation Mission Request - Season 5 GovNERD(s)\r\n\r\n**Foundation Mission Summary:** govNERDs improve governance accessibility by shepherding proposals through the feedback, approval, and voting process. This will be especially important in Season 5 as we run new processes (Delegate Mission Requests) and bring Citizens’ House governance online. **We plan to transition the govNERDs to an open contribution path before Season 6 begins.** \r\n\r\n**S5 [Intent](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874):** Governance accessibility\r\n\r\n**Proposal [Tier](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877):** Ember\r\n\r\n**Baseline grant amount:** 13,500 OP per GovNERD\r\n\r\n**Should this Foundation Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:** Up to 3; 1 govNERD will be dedicated to Citizens’ House. Additional govNERDs may be added throughout the Season as needed, these govNERDs would receive a pro-rata portion of the grant for the portion of the Season they are active. \r\n\r\n**OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Sponsor:** @op_lavande\r\n\r\n**Submit by:** December 1st at 23:59 GMT\r\n\r\n**Selection by:** December 6th at 23:59 GMT\r\n\r\n**Start date:** December 7th \r\n\r\n**Completion date:** May 8th (tentative end of Season 5) \r\n\r\n**Foundation Point of Contact:** @op_lavande and @Nicca42\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Mission Request\r\n\r\n### **How will this Foundation Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?**\r\n\r\nThe iterative nature of Optimism governance means it is constantly changing. While this should ultimately lead to improvements in the health of the overall governance system, it makes the system harder to navigate and has lowered accessibility of Optimism governance. govNERDs help shepherd proposals through the feedback, approval, and voting process while ensuring the forum is a place for the highest quality engagement. This improves governance accessibility by making it easier for proposers to effectively navigate the proposal process and for voters to find the high quality proposals that require their attention in both Houses. \r\n\r\nThis Season, we will add an additional govNERD focused on supporting RetroPGF rounds. \r\n\r\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission Request?**\r\n\r\ngovNERDs will serve as neutral shepherds that ensure high quality governance proposals move through the proposal process successfully, taking over some important administrative work the Optimism Foundation has thus far fulfilled.\r\n\r\n***General Governance Process:***\r\n\r\n- Ensure voters understand relevant processes during Season 5, clarifying any ambiguities in documentation\r\n- Attend governance community calls to identify and clarify areas of confusion about Season 5\r\n- Maintain the public governance calendar during Season 5, updating and circulating as needed\r\n- Maintain the Token House and Citizen’s House Onboarding Hubs\r\n\r\n***Proposal Feedback Process:***\r\n\r\n- Ensure all Season 5 proposals follow templates, gathering feedback on templates and suggesting improvements to the Optimism Foundation. This is especially important for Delegate Mission Requests.\r\n- Address any inconsistencies or non-compliance in proposals\r\n- Identify where there is overlap in proposals and help proposers reduce overlap or collaborate\r\n- Facilitate timely feedback from voters on high quality proposals\r\n\r\n***Proposal Approval Process:***\r\n\r\n- Facilitate the review of proposals that require approvals by voters in advance of the deadline required to move to a vote\r\n- Aid the Foundation in implementing any processes aimed at making the Mission Request approval process easier\r\n\r\n***Proposal Voting Process:***\r\n\r\n- Alert voters to the start and end of Special Voting Cycles and any other deadlines during the Reflection Period\r\n- Manage Voting Cycle Roundups, adding approved proposals to the roundup before the deadline\r\n- Draft copy for votes, to be reviewed and approved by the Foundation\r\n- Ensure voters understand what they need to be voting on throughout Season 5\r\n\r\n***Proposal Veto Process:***\r\n\r\n- Ensure voters are aware of any veto windows, and that they understand how to veto and what a veto means, throughout Season 5 (this pertains to Citizens’ House in Season 5)\r\n\r\n***Forum Management:***\r\n\r\n- Monitor, manage, and reduce low quality forum engagement during Season 5\r\n- Manage discourse tags to aid discoverability of relevant proposals during Season 5\r\n- Flag important posts and/or comments to the Optimism Foundation\r\n- Aid the Foundation in posting future Reflection Period posts to the forum\r\n- Assist with on-chain analytics reports (more details to be published soon)\r\n\r\nThis Season, we will add an additional govNERD focused on supporting RetroPGF rounds. This govNERD will: \r\n\r\n- Support RetroPGF applicants throughout the process of a round\r\n- Ensure applicants are aware that a round is taking place\r\n- Support applicants in tracking their impact\r\n- Answer questions relating to the application process\r\n- Support third party RetroPGF tooling such as [RetroPGFhub](https://retropgfhub.com/) and [RetroLists](https://retrolist.app/)\r\n\r\n#### The exact scope of govNERDs may evolve over the course of the Season\r\n\r\n### **How should the Foundation measure progress towards this Mission?**\r\n\r\n- If this Mission is successful, the Foundation should be able to remove its role in the following functions:\r\n    - Maintenance of the public governance calendar during Season 5\r\n    - Procedural questions raised in governance community calls\r\n    - Announcements to voters pertaining to voting cycles or general governance schedules (without a corresponding decrease in turnout per proposal)\r\n    - Alerts related to proposals receiving enough approvals to move to a vote, when required\r\n    - Publication of Voting Cycle Roundups\r\n    - Reduction in forum spam, as measured by the number of forum issues the Foundation is asked to address\r\n    - Applicant support during retroPGF rounds \r\n\r\n### **How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?**\r\n\r\n- The Foundation may attest to the reduction in workload as a result of govNERDs taking on work for which the Foundation used to be responsible\r\n- The Foundation will document any positive or negative feedback from delegates and Citizens interacting with govNERDs throughout the Reflection Period and share a summary\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Application Instructions:**\r\n\r\nTo apply for this Mission Request, please complete the form below and submit as a comment on this issue thread.

While grants from Optimism Governance are effective in aligning builders with Optimism’s long-term success, builders sometimes need capital in order to cover up-front development and growth costs. \r\n\r\nTo complete this Mission, the Collective is looking for someone to establish an Optimism Ecosystem Investment Network that connects builders and investors. This project should:\r\n- Aggregate a cohort of investors interested in connecting with builders on OP Mainnet and understand their investment thesis\r\n- Establish a scalable process for aggregating and collating the flow: process to source leads from all relevant avenues, clear application instructions for projects, simple yet informative application template, and reliable pattern to share project details with investor groups\r\n- Facilitate introductions between builders and investors where and when appropriate \r\n- Gather feedback from investors and builders on the process and identify ways to improve the program\r\n\r\nThis Mission does not include the following: \r\n- Advice or participation in structuring deal terms between investors and builders.\r\n- Making investment recommendations or providing financial advice. \r\n \r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nVenture investment plays an important role in the long-term vision for Optimism. Today, Optimism runs regular rounds of Retroactive Public Goods Funding to builders contributing to the public good of the Optimism Collective. Eventually, venture investment can be an important part of this funding mechanism: RetroPGF can create a market of investable projects by providing an \"exit\" in the form of funding from RPGF rounds. This allows venture investors to invest in exchange for equity or for future funding from RPGF, if received by the team. This helps make seed capital from venture investors more accessible to builders who need access to funding in order to start building. For more on this topic, read Vitalik’s [guest post](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) on the Optimism blog. \r\n\r\nThis is not required for this Mission Request or for the Ecosystem Investment Network. It is included here as context to help influence how this project could evolve over time. \r\n\r\n### **What milestones will help the Collective track progress towards completion of this Foundation Mission Request (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n- Clear project plan with milestones and projected dates for completion of each milestone.\r\n- Published process to source leads throughout the ecosystem \r\n- Published process for projects to participate in the network\r\n- Go-live date and launch for the first iteration of the program\r\n\r\n\r\n### **How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nA successful Mission may be measured on: \r\n- number of projects and investment groups participating in the network\r\n- number of introductions of projects and investors\r\n\r\nBadgeholders may also identify more rigorous or quantitative metrics of success at their discretion as part of the retroPGF evaluation process.\r\n\r\n---\r\n \r\n## Application instructions\r\nTo apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread.

An important piece that is missing in the toolbox is an open-source, easy-to-use explorer that allows anyone to spin up an explorer easily while providing better than etherscan UX for their end users. \r\n\r\nL2scan is multi-chain by default. This allows users to monitor and analyze txs, assets, and other vital data without switching platforms. The open-source version of L2scan will provide developers who want to build on opstack an out-of-box, easy-to-use explorer with low maintenance cost. (blockscout alternative) \r\n\r\nAlso, we want to provide the hosted version of L2scan as the AI-powered blockchain explorer to the Optimism ecosystem.

    "body": "**What is an Ecosystem Project Idea?**\n\nAn Ecosystem Project Idea is an idea for a project that someone could build within the Optimism ecosystem. As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**This project is for creating a frontend that allows users to explore how RetroPGF voting badges are distributed.**\n\nRecently, the voting badge distribution for RetroPGF round 3 has kicked off - you can find the full announcement [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-voting-badge-distribution/6557) 👈\nTo drive transparency and understanding it would be valueble to visualize how voting badges are distributed. Badgeholders are selected through a multiple selection methods. \n@smartcontracts prev built a frontend that allows you to visualize a specific attestation schema. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/smartcontracts/coolgraph) https://github.com/smartcontracts/coolgraph 👈\n\n![Image](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/gov-internal/assets/43515441/0c769250-1c69-4b95-a404-b02e26759844)\n\nThis project can pick up on the existing visualizer and make minor changes to visualize the voting badge distribution or add new features that make this a useful tool for visualizing badgeholder attestations and attestations at large. \n\n### Resources\n- [Badgeholder EAS schema](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xfdcfdad2dbe7489e0ce56b260348b7f14e8365a8a325aef9834818c00d46b31b), \n  - I deployed a version of it on Goerli for experimentation [here](https://optimism-goerli-bedrock.easscan.org/schema/view/0x59631c889e2c1f9befae214d3aecf7e865d987cee5ff8c29ddbaa0b50010a34b)\n- [RetroPGF round 3 voting badge distribution](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-voting-badge-distribution/6557) \n- [RetroPGF round 2 voting badge distribution](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-2/#)\n- [Get nerdsniped on attestations ](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/intro/)\n\n**OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Contact**: Jonas (gh: @JSeiferth, TG/Discord: @jonassft)\n\n## Possible Features\n- **Basic**: Make changes to [coolgraph](https://github.com/smartcontracts/coolgraph) to display [badgeholder attestations](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xfdcfdad2dbe7489e0ce56b260348b7f14e8365a8a325aef9834818c00d46b31b) and host it to be available to users. \n  - If the `refferedMethod` is \"badgeholderChoice\", the source should be the `referredBy` address and the target the attestation recipient\n  - if the `refferedMethod` is not badgeholderChoice, the source should be the `refferedMethod`(e.g. Foundation Choice, Past Badgeholder, Token House Elected or RetroPGF Recipient)\n- **Extended**: Display how voting badges were distributed over multiple rounds (round 2 & round 3 + future rounds)\n- **Extended**: Allow to discover the path of a specific voting badge - e.g. I can see how a specific badgeholder attained a voting badge and the relevant social graph \n- **Extended**: Display the [Optimist NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/optimist-nft) associated with each address\n-  **SuperFeature**: Allow for the visualization of any attestation by enabling users to input any EAS Schema\n- **SuperFeatureExtended**: Allow for the visualization of any attestation schema by enabling users to input any EAS schema and select arbitrary data fields to be visualized. \n\n## Impact\n- This can help drive understanding in the Citizens' House of how badgeholders are selected\n- This drives understanding of Optimism's identity layer \n- This could be the basis of a visual attestation explorer, a useful tool for users to interact with Optimism's identity layer\n\n",

A good voting experience is core to supporting the work of badgeholders and ensuring an accurate RetroPGF process.  \n\nRound 2 of RetroPGF put a high burden on the voting experience of badgeholders, requiring them to do a lot of manual work spreadsheets and forms.  This friction limited the overall accuracy of the RetroPGF round.  \n\nRound 3 of RetroPGF is set to[ build on the learnings of round 2](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/7v1DehEY3dpRcYFhqWrVNc9Qj94H2L976LKlWH1FX-8) and provide a richer and more intuitive experience for browsing projects and submitting votes.   \n\nBy doing so, this mission will contribute to a more accurate evaluation of projects and contribute to the overall success of RetroPGF 3. \n\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\n\nCompleting this mission requires:\n1. Building a frontend that powers the discovery of projects and voting by badgeholders in RetroPGF round 3. The frontend will be based on existing designs and user stories and will utilize the Ethereum Attestation Service, and a combination of onchain and offchain (storage bucket, IPFS, etc.) sources to read data. The frontend should be fully open-source and should allow for future iterations of the functionality. The Foundation will provide product designs; this RFP primarily requires implementation. \n2. Hosting and managing the application infrastructure, including backend infrastructure needed to capture and store badgeholder votes.\n\n**Core functionality of the discovery & voting application**:\n\n* **Discover Projects**: The application will enable users to explore all nominated projects, including search, filtering and sorting functionality.\n* **Viewing a Project's Profile**: Users will be able to discover the profile of a specific project, populated with details provided by the project's team. The information will include general information about the project (name, creator, profile picture, social media links, etc.) and specific information relevant to RetroPGF’s goal of aligning impact and profit (description of contributions, links to contributions, impact description, funding history, etc.). \n* **Discovering and voting on Lists**: A standout new feature of round 3 will be 'Lists', a new tool for badgeholders to share their votes with others. Users will be able to discover, search, filter and sort Lists. By selecting a List, a user will find general information about the list (name, creator, description, impact evaluation description) and the votes on a number of projects included in a list. Badgeholders will be able to either directly import the votes of the list into their ballot, or edit the votes in a list based on their preferences, before adding them to their ballot. \n* **Allocating and submitting votes**: Badgeholders will be able to allocate and submit votes. Badgeholders are voting on individual project profiles or via a list (see above). All votes are aggregated in a badgeholders ballot, where badgeholders are able to see an overview of their votes, make changes to individual votes and submit their ballot. \n\n**Technical Architecture and implementation**:\n\n* **Query project data**: Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is used to query existing onchain information relating to entities, their RetroPGF 3 application, and social verifications. Relevant schema information and indexer will be provided once the proposal has been accepted. \n  * An entity represents individuals or organizations\n  * An application represents an entity’s application for RetroPGF and maps 1:1 to an entity. \n  * A social verification represents an attestation made by OptimismFND that indiciates an entity is the owner of a specific Twitter or GitHub account\n* **Query project lists**: Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is leveraged to query existing onchain information relating to project lists. Relevant schema information and indexer will be provided once the proposal has been accepted.\n* **Create a voting backend**: Backend infrastructure is required to capture and store votes, badgeholder votes will be private and stored on a backend server hosted by yourself. Minor features in the application may require additional backend support. \n* You will host the application yourself and maintain it until March 2024. Optimism Foundation will help you host this application at an optimism.io subdomain\n* Everything that you build should be open-source under MIT license and should allow for future iterations of the functionality. \n\nFor this Mission, the Optimism Foundation will accept **up to two submissions**. Multiple frontends will maximize the likelihood of success and improve the resilience of the system.  \n\nThe rollout of functionality of the application will be done in multiple phases:\n* Phase 1: Project discovery (early-October 2023) - users are able to discover eligible projects and view project profiles. \n* Phase 2: Voting (mid-October  2023)- badgeholders are able to discover lists and to allocate and submit votes. \n\nPlease find [user stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1msALT4H9-77WLfWlFW72eX4Mxd7urpcmrppWMBQyBvI/edit?usp=sharing),  [designs](https://www.figma.com/file/DcoTZUiL9SqWgPjPjLCKHN/RetroPGF-3---Voting?type=design&node-id=172%3A24948&mode=design&t=EUuU8XdssEbeZkpD-1) and [EAS & Metadata Schemas](https://gist.github.com/jakim929/d8269973aa87862fa91037d3be3c4d7f) for the application linked.

As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAs it currently stands, users need to utilize the SDK or other low-level mechanisms to replay L1 => L2 or L2 => L1 transactions that ran out of gas. This can be complex for average users. A good tool would provide an interactive user interface for replaying transactions. This tool aims to simplify this process and make it more accessible.\r\n\r\n## Potential Features\r\n- **Query and Display Failed Transactions**: The tool would provide functionality to query both L1 and L2 chains using a user's public address to find transactions that have failed due to running out of gas. Should also be able to support searching by a specific transaction hash.\r\n- **Customize Gas Limit**: The user interface would allow users to specify a higher gas limit for replaying the failed transaction.\r\n- **Safe Replaying**: Before replaying, the tool should provide a cost estimation for the transaction and ask for user confirmation, this makes sure that the custom gas limit is going to be high enough.\r\n- **Tutorial and Help**: The tool would include a brief tutorial or walkthrough on how to use it, along with tooltips or help text to guide users.\r\n- **Real-time Updates**: The tool would offer real-time updates on the status of the transaction once replayed.\r\n- **Transaction History**: It should have the functionality to keep a history of all replayed transactions for a given address.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- **Increased Usability**: This tool will drastically improve the experience for users who face gas issues during transactions between L1 and L2.\r\n- **Accessibility**: It will make L2 interactions more accessible for non-technical users by removing the need to use the SDK for these transactions.\r\n- **Reduced Transaction Failures**: The tool will help to reduce the number of failed transactions on the network, leading to improved overall network health.\r\n- **Better User Experience**: By giving users control over their gas limits, it provides a more personalized and user-friendly interaction with L2.\r\n- **Educational**: This tool can serve as an educational resource for users to better understand gas costs and transaction dynamics in L2.\r\n",

Mad Science Project Ideas make great hackathon projects and tend to be a great way to explore Optimism, OP Mainnet, and the OP Stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis project aims to leverage the OP Stack chains, without a Sequencer, to index data. In particular, these chains, dubbed \"Indexing Chains,\" can capture various L1 data, such as gas burn information. By doing this, we can potentially replace the Ultra Sound Money website backend with an OP Stack chain Rollup. To do this, you would need to modify the OP Stack chain to constantly keep track of the L1 gas burn and store that information in an L2 smart contract.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Implement an Indexing Chain to track L1 gas burn.\r\n- Store the L1 gas burn in an L2 smart contract.\r\n- Replace the Ultra Sound Money website backend with the newly created Indexing Chain.\r\n- Query the L1 gas burn from the L2 smart contract via the USM website.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- It offers a novel and efficient way to index L1 data.\r\n- Enhances the robustness and performance of the Ultra Sound Money website backend.\r\n- Showcases the versatility of the OP Stack chains for tasks beyond Sequencer-based operations.\r\n",

As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nOriginally, Optimism considered introducing an attestation-based challenger module as a pathway towards decentralization. Though focus has shifted towards fault proofs, the attestation-based module remains a fascinating and worthwhile concept. Instead of a multisig, this module would utilize a smart contract that verifies EIP-712 signatures. Any participant could call the smart contract with an array of signatures and a proposed output hash for a given L2 block number. If a threshold of signatures approves that output hash for that block number— and if the existing proposed output hash in the L2OutputOracle contract differs from the signed-off proposal—then the original proposed output hash is discarded.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Develop a slim server with a simple API route such as `/signature/block/N` that returns a signature over the correct proposal hash for block N.\r\n- Design the API to be callable by anyone.\r\n- If an incorrect proposal on L1 is detected, the API would be called on various known machines to obtain a threshold of signatures.\r\n- Incorporate a smart contract that accepts a proposed output hash for an L2 block number and a threshold of signatures.\r\n- If the threshold is met, and the proposed hash differs from the existing one in the L2OutputOracle, the existing proposal is removed.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Offer a novel approach towards securing the integrity of L2 block proposals.\r\n- Contribute to the broader ecosystem's understanding of decentralization mechanisms.\r\n- Help test the potential effectiveness of attestation-based challenger modules in a blockchain context.\r\n- Better than multisigs, easier than fault proofs.\r\n",

L2Geth, our legacy system, has two main parts: the Data Transport Layer (DTL) responsible for indexing data from Ethereum, and L2Geth itself, built on an older version of Geth. It would be interesting to have a new version of L2Geth that is based on the latest stable version of Geth. This might make syncing legacy OP Mainnet nodes faster and more reliable. You can continue to use the DTL or build your own consensus/execution client split—similar to how the OP Stack operates post-Bedrock.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Use of the latest stable release of Geth.\r\n- Option to use the current DTL or develop a custom consensus client.\r\n- Focus on L1 syncing, no need for Sequencer logic.\r\n- No need for p2p logic.\r\n- Rapid and efficient syncing of the legacy system, optimizing storage space.\r\n- Should be able to correctly sync the legacy system, can compare to old legacy nodes.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Speeding up the sync process for anyone needing to access legacy data.\r\n- Increasing the reliability of legacy nodes for those who keep them for archival purposes.\r\n",

The interface should allow users to efficiently configure all the required files necessary for the deployment, as well as handle the smart contract deployment. One potential source of inspiration for this project is the Arbitrum Orbit Deployment user interface. After successful deployment, the interface should provide users with the configuration files and instruct them on how to run `op-node` and `op-geth` components using these files.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- A simple yet comprehensive setup process that enables users to configure all the necessary files for the deployment.\r\n- An integrated deployment mechanism that deploys the smart contracts on behalf of the users.\r\n- Post-deployment, the interface should provide an option to download the configuration files.\r\n- Clear instructions and guides on how to operate `op-node` and `op-geth` with the provided configuration files.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n\r\n- It can significantly streamline the process of spinning up an OP Stack based blockchain, making it accessible to a wider range of users.\r\n- By simplifying the configuration and deployment process, it may encourage more experimentation and development on the OP Stack.\r\n- It can enhance the user experience by providing guidance and clarity post-deployment, contributing to a smoother onboarding process.\r\n",

This shift could potentially leave out projects that are not aware of the process or the opportunity. To bridge this gap, we propose the creation of a public nomination form that anyone can fill out to nominate projects. The results of this form can be made available on a public read-only spreadsheet. This would allow teams to review community nominations and reach out to promising projects that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\nNote: The RetroPGF sign-up itself is being build by the OP Labs EcoPod team and will go live in the coming months. This Project Idea's sole focus is a form for the community to suggest projects that should sign-up\n\n**OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Contact**: Jonas (gh: @JSeiferth, TG/Discord: @jonassft)\n\n## Possible Features\n\n- The form should be easy to fill out and provide clear instructions to guide nominators.\n- It should include specific fields designed to capture as much relevant information about the nominated project as possible.\n- The results of the form submissions should be automatically populated to a public read-only spreadsheet.\n- To prevent the influx of spammy entries, consider implementing basic form validation and moderation features.\n\n## Impact\n\n- It can help identify projects that might not be aware of RetroPGF and provide them with the opportunity to participate.\n- The publicly available spreadsheet of nominations can serve as a valuable resource for teams, giving them the ability to review and reach out to nominated projects.\n- This process could increase the pool of eligible projects for RetroPGF, resulting in a more diverse and inclusive grant process.\n",

In certain cases, developers might find the free tiers insufficient for their needs, leading to the necessity of purchasing premium packages. A potential solution to this issue can be the development of a high-quality RPC proxy that developers can host themselves. The key objective is to make the proxy straightforward and easy-to-configure so that it is accessible to developers at different levels of experience.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- It should be easy to set up, configure, and integrate with existing systems.\r\n- The proxy should be capable of intelligently managing and routing requests to different providers based on their rate limits and the current request load.\r\n- It should be resilient and fault-tolerant, with the ability to failover to different providers in the event of an outage or if rate limits are exceeded.\r\n- The proxy should provide comprehensive logging and monitoring features to help developers understand the request load, rate limit usage, and the performance of different providers.\r\n- It should be able to work around the tier limits so that users are spending as little money as possible by taking advantage of existing free tiers.\r\n- Maybe some sort of UI for managing the proxy.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- It could potentially save developers considerable time, effort, and money by removing the need to manage interactions with different RPC providers and their respective limits.\r\n- By providing a robust and fault-tolerant solution, it can increase the reliability of applications that rely on RPCs.\r\n- The enhanced logging and monitoring can provide valuable insights into the performance and usage of different RPC providers, which can inform optimization efforts and reduce costs.\r\n",

Draft Project Ideas may be converted into Ecosystem Project Ideas as they are explored further and more thoroughly specified.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nUsers frequently perform withdrawals from OP Mainnet back to Ethereum. It is critical to track these transactions accurately and efficiently for overall network safety. To aid in this, we propose the development of a unified user interface (UI) that allows monitoring all these withdrawals in one place. This UI would track the various statuses that a withdrawal may undergo during its lifecycle, thereby providing a clear overview of withdrawal activities on the OP Mainnet.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Track all withdrawals initiated on the OP Mainnet (L2).\r\n- Monitor when these L2 withdrawals are proven on Ethereum (L1).\r\n- Highlight if any withdrawals are proven on L1 that weren't initiated on L2, indicating a critical bug.\r\n- Keep track of when withdrawals are finalized on L1.\r\n- Provide detailed parsing of withdrawal transactions. For example:\r\n  - If the withdrawal is transferring tokens, identify and display the token type and the amount.\r\n  - If the withdrawal transaction does not involve token transfer, make an attempt to determine the purpose of the transaction.\r\n- In cases where the transaction's purpose remains unclear, mark it with a visible identifier (like a question mark) on the UI to facilitate further investigation by the team or the community.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Enhanced security: By offering an easy-to-use interface for manual review of withdrawals, it can significantly improve the safety of OP Mainnet and other chains based on the OP Stack.\r\n- Engaging and informative UI: This interface would be interesting and educational for users, providing a clearer picture of withdrawal activities.\r\n",

Mad Science Project Ideas make great hackathon projects and tend to be a great way to explore Optimism, OP Mainnet, and the OP Stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nA significant part of understanding the state and health of a blockchain lies in the transaction activity. Transactions come in many types and offer a wealth of information about the on-chain activity. Despite the abundance of data, there's a lack of deeper dimensional visualization tools that extend beyond simple total transaction counts. To address this, a proposal for the development of a transaction visualizer is put forward. This visualizer, ideally presented as an interactive website, would provide real-time insights into transaction flows, giving users a new way to engage with OP Mainnet.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Real-time transaction flows: The visualizer should provide a live stream of transactions as they occur on the blockchain.\r\n- Distinct representations for different transaction types: Each transaction type should be distinctly represented, possibly through different colors or shapes, to allow for easy differentiation.\r\n- Grouping transactions from the same sender: Transactions from the same sender could be grouped together to provide further insights into transaction patterns.\r\n- Aesthetic appeal: The visualizer should have a strong visual appeal, making it not just informative but also engaging to interact with.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- It provides a more visceral and immediate understanding of the transactional activity on the OP Mainnet.\r\n- In times of network congestion or when transactions are unusually low, this could be immediately noticeable on the visualizer, aiding in faster diagnostics.\r\n- By offering a new way to engage with the data, it could attract a broader audience to learn more about the OP Mainnet and its activities.\r\n",

Mad Science Project Ideas make great hackathon projects and tend to be a great way to explore Optimism, OP Mainnet, and the OP Stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis project involves creating a simple Twitter clone but with a twist - we'll be using attestations and the [AttestationStation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/atst-v1/) smart contract. In this clone, usual Twitter interactions, such as liking, following, and tweeting, will be implemented as attestations. This project aims to demonstrate the functionality of attestations through a popular social media platform's model.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Implement the ability for users to 'like' tweets, represented as an attestation. This shows how a simple interaction on the platform can be modeled.\r\n- Include the feature for users to retweet. This attestation captures the process of content sharing within the network.\r\n- Implement 'following' other users as an attestation, this shows how relationships and interests can be represented.\r\n- The ability to 'tweet' or post messages. Each tweet is an attestation, representing a content contribution by a user to the network.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- This project is fun and educational. It provides a hands-on exploration of attestations.\r\n- By implementing a Twitter-like platform using attestations, we demonstrate the power and versatility of attestations in a practical and relatable context.\r\n- This project provides a solid foundation for further contributions. Other developers could build on it, either by adding more features or scaling it up.\r\n",

    "body": "# Foundation Mission (RFP) – Remote Static Call Proof of Concept\r\n\r\n*To take on this project, submit a proposal to this thread by xxx. Read more about Missions [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881).*\r\n\r\n- **S4 Intent**: Progress Towards Technical Decentralization\r\n- **Proposal Tier:** [Ember](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877)\r\n- **Baseline grant amount**: 15k OP\r\n- **Accepting one or multiple proposals:** Multiple\r\n- **OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Sponsor:** Mark (@tynes)\r\n- **Submit by**: July 18, 2023 at 19:00 GMT\r\n- **Selection by**: July 28, 2023 at 19:00 GMT\r\n\r\n### **How will this Foundation Mission (RFP) help accomplish the above Intent?**\r\n\r\nA decentralized future is one where there are many L2 rollup chains. In order to support many L2 chains without introducing too much fragmentation it is critical that there is shared state between them. This RFP introduces a new REMOTESTATICCALL primitive which allows L2 nodes to query L1 state statically using the existing STATICCALL RPC. This greatly improves the flexibility of querying the shared state between chains.\r\n\r\nThis can be used for novel use-cases such as:\r\n\r\n1. Cross-chain wallet management — see Vitalik’s recent post\r\n2. Oracle update reading — read oracle values on L1\r\n3. EVM-based indexers — when combined with [custom attributes in the derivation function](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/tutorials/add-attr/), this enables more generalized L1 state inspection for provable EVM-based indexers.\r\n\r\nTons of use cases become possible!\r\n\r\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n**********************************Success criteria:**********************************\r\n\r\n- A fork of Optimism where the local devnet includes all of the changes required for the REMOTESTATICCALL functionality.\r\n- A test suite which can be run against the local devnet which deploys contracts that use the REMOTESTATICCALL functionality and show it is working.\r\n- This includes:\r\n    - Simple gas metering of the REMOTESTATICCALL\r\n    - Bonus: Analysis or recommendations for what the gas metering should be if deployed to production\r\n\r\n******************************Recommended solution:******************************\r\n\r\n- Implement a precompile in op-geth which makes a STATICCALL RPC request to the L1 Geth. The gas is proportional to the gas allocated to the CALL of the precompile. The STATICCALL made to L1 Geth uses the latest L1 blockhash stored in the L2 `L1Block` predeploy.\r\n- Archive node of L1 Geth so the STATICCALL can be made on historical blocks.\r\n    - Bonus: Avoid needing an archive node.\r\n\r\n### **How should the Foundation measure progress towards this Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nProgress can be measured based upon the completion of the following milestones:\r\n\r\n- Specification: A specification for how the REMOTESTATICCALL would be implemented. This includes the interface to the precompile and its gas consumption.\r\n- Geth PoC: A single commit to op-geth which adds the functionality and unit tests.\r\n- Executable devnet demo: An easy to run test suite against the standard Optimism devnet which demonstrates the functionality.\r\n\r\n### **How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n- Number of developers who understand this new primitive\r\n    - Fewer lines of code is better\r\n    - More documentation is better\r\n- Number of developers who want this new primitive\r\n- Number of developers building on top of this new primitive\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Application instructions\r\n\r\n_To apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread.

Since this information is already public, it can be valuable to make it more easily accessible in the form of an on-chain attestation. A GitHub PR Attestation Bot would automatically make an attestation every time a PR is merged into a repository's main branch. This attestation would contain a reference to the repository, the specific PR, the branch name the PR was merged to, and the GitHub username of the account that created the PR.\r\n\r\nAttestations should be published to the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://optimism-goerli.easscan.org/) version of the [AttestationStation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/build/) (ATST). As of the creation of this PR, this version is only available on OP Goerli, but the bot should be designed to support OP Mainnet as well once the mainnet ATST has been upgraded to EAS. \r\n\r\nAn ideal version of this bot would be configured with the following:\r\n- RPC URL to be used when publishing attestations\r\n- Private key to use when publishing attestations\r\n- Branch or branches to look for PRs to\r\n\r\nThis can take the form of a GitHub actions task or a GitHub app. \r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Allow repository owners to install your GitHub action or GitHub app\r\n- Allow repository owners to configure your GitHub action or GitHub app with the above listed config options\r\n- Automatically publish an attestation when a PR is merged\r\n- Create a schema that represents the attestations based on the required information\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Help projects keep track of their contributors\r\n- Help contributors be potentially rewarded via RPGF",

Read more about Missions [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881)._\r\n\r\n- **Foundation Mission Summary:** Governor Contract v2\r\n- **S4 Intent**: Improve Governance Accessibility\r\n- **Proposal Tier**: [Eagle](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877)\r\n- **Baseline grant amount:** 400k OP\r\n- **Should this Foundation Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple Alliances:** One\r\n- **Optimism Foundation point-of-contact:** Bobby (@bdresser)\r\n- **Submit by**: June 28th at 19:00 GMT\r\n- **Selection by**: July 13th at 19:00 GMT\r\n\r\n\r\n## **How will this Foundation Mission (RFP) help accomplish the above Intent?:**\r\n\r\nThis RFP will help the Token House governance system continue to evolve in pursuit of usability and participation, which will also further increase the social decentralization of the Collective.\r\n\r\nThe [v1 Governor Contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xcdf27f107725988f2261ce2256bdfcde8b382b10#code) moved the Token House to an MVP version of onchain voting. Based on delegate feedback, this RFP details a set of improvements aimed at improving delegation UX, solving existing painpoints with voting operations, and experimenting with new forms of delegation. All of these improvements should make it easier for delegates to participate in Optimism governance. \r\n\r\n## **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nAn upgrade to the existing Governor Contract that includes the following functionality: \r\n\r\n- **Partial delegation:** the ability for any address to delegate only a portion of their tokens to an address, or for an address to delegate multiple portions of their tokens to multiple addresses.\r\n- **Accurate votable supply quorum calculation**: quorum for each vote should be calculated as a portion of the “total votable supply,” the total number of OP currently delegated to vote. (Today, the quorum for each vote is set manually on the contract.)\r\n- **Support for different proposal types:** the contract should support different proposal types that correspond to the proposal types in the Optimism Operating Manual, each of which may have a different quorum and approval threshold. In addition, the contract should include a straightforward path to (a) add new proposal types, and (b) manage proposal types’ quorums and approval thresholds.\r\n- **Support for different vote types:** The contract should support different vote types beyond the current “simple vote” (yes / no / abstain). These should include single choice voting (i.e. for use in an election), and approval voting (i.e. for use in approving Missions), as well as an approach for extensibility such that other voting strategies can be added in the future.\r\n- **Integrate new contract functionality into a voting UI:** The contract improvements above should be usable by governance participants with varying degrees of technical expertise. An ideal proposal includes a plan to surface this new functionality to voters in a straightforward UI.\r\n\r\nThis RFP will consider proposals that include modifications to this scope. Additional upgrades or adjustments are fair game to propose and may warrant a re-evaluation of total RFP grant amount. \r\n\r\n## **What milestones will help the Collective track progress towards completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n1. Specification for implementation, design approach, and architecture for the functionality listed above. \r\n2. Monthly progress updates on design and/or implementation.\r\n3. Open-source code repository to observe progress over time. \r\n\r\n## **How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n- All future Token House proposals are voted on successfully through the updated Governor contract.\r\n- Number of addresses using partial delegation.\r\n- Clarity on voting UIs around the type, status, and result of various proposal types.\r\n- Success in using alternate vote types in order to make decisions on various topics.\r\n- Reduction in Foundation time spent operationalizing proposals for each voting cycle.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Application instructions\r\n\r\n_To apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread below.

Read more about Missions [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881)._\r\n\r\n* **S4 Intent**: Progress Towards Technical Decentralization \r\n* **Proposal Tier:**  [Ember](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877)\r\n* **Baseline grant amount**: 30k OP\r\n* **Accepting one or multiple proposals:** Multiple \r\n* **OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Sponsor:** Mark (@tynesol)\r\n* **Submit by**: June 28th at 19:00 GMT\r\n* **Selection by**: July 13th at 19:00 GMT\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### What is Leader Election?\r\n\r\nLeader election is simply the ability to have different leaders that are responsible for creating the next canonical state transition in a distributed system. In a blockchain, leader election gives the ability for different block producers to produce blocks at different times. Leader election algorithms can be racy or race free.\r\n\r\nA racy leader election algorithm is where many potential leaders are competing at the same time to be the leader, this is the case with proof of work. A race free leader election algorithm is when there is a single known leader at a particular point in time and there is no other way for a different potential leader to be the leader at that time, this is the case with Ethereum Gasper.\r\n\r\nWith Proposer-Builder Separation, the block builder (also known as a validator or a proposer) is virtualized in the sense where a network of block builders that are ultimately responsible for selecting the ordering of the transactions and then the proposer is simply responsible for signing off on the block. This turns the single entity that was responsible for producing a block at a particular slot into many possible entities that are all competing for building the most profitable block during the slot, so the raciness has returned because of MEV.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to understand the various second order effects of different leader election mechanisms for an op-stack chain. Leader election is desired as a feature because it can be used to make sequencing more decentralized. It does not guarantee that sequencing is more decentralized, so be careful when thinking about the coveted “decentralized sequencer”.\r\n\r\n### What is Decentralized Sequencing?\r\n\r\nYou could define a decentralized sequencer as 1) permissionless entry to proposer set, 2) some weighted probability of being elected leader based on a costly signal. Decentralized sequencing is a spectrum. Introducing PBS can slightly decentralize sequencing, but it will not give the property of censorship resistance because the single sequencer has the right to censor any block that they choose. Decentralized sequencing gives the property of censorship resistance, as if transactions are being censored then its possible for new sequencers to join the network and begin to include transactions that were previously being censored.\r\n\r\n### What is the MVP for leader election?\r\n\r\nAllow the batch inbox to be a smart contract and check in the derivation pipeline that the transactions do not revert. This would allow developers to experiment with leader election mechanisms that are based on an L1 smart contract. This would require a few changes:\r\n\r\n- Gas estimation when creating the batch instead of computing the gas limit client side based on the intrinsic gas in the batcher\r\n- Batcher needs to be able to know when its the leader and when its not, so create a standard interface that all smart contracts used as the batch inbox must implement, so the batcher can submit batches only when it is its turn\r\n- Modifying the [[derivation pipeline](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/edb6603feb5f49f2fdfe41f4b39c91695ed81ff8/op-node/rollup/derive/calldata_source.go#L107)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/edb6603feb5f49f2fdfe41f4b39c91695ed81ff8/op-node/rollup/derive/calldata_source.go#L107) to ensure that reverted transactions are not included, the receipts are necessary for this in the linked context\r\n- Remove the check that the `tx.from` is equal to the batch sender when the [[batcherHash](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/system_config.md#batcherhash-bytes32)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/system_config.md#batcherhash-bytes32) is version 1. The version is just the first byte, I don’t see a reason as to not just use `bytes32(1)` although there may be useful information that could be included in the bytes following the version byte\r\n- Pull the number of L2 blocks per channel into consensus and make it very easy to determine when channels open/close from the smart contract\r\n- A simple smart contract that implements a permissioned set of leaders and round robins between them as a proof of concept\r\n- Nice to have: add the batch inbox to the system config with a setter so it can be modified via governance and emit an event when it changes so the leader election mechanism can be dynamically changed by governance\r\n- Nice to have: a way for the fee recipient to be able to be set by the current sequencer, right now it is deterministic and always set to a predeploy\r\n\r\nA contract that is a batch inbox should not read the full batch into memory, it should simply implement a fallback function and then do logic based on the `msg.sender` and be able to track channels. Once certain design patterns are proven out in the smart contract, they can be pulled into the derivation function similar to “precompiles” and then op-stack users can configure which sort of leader election mechanism they would like. Experimentation for leader election can now happen outside of the core protocol in parallel by anybody that wants to work on it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **How will this RFP help the Collective progress towards technical decentralization?**\r\n\r\nLeader election opens up the ability for multiple entities to act as a sequencer and produce canonical blocks. When there is only a single sequencer, there is risk that this sequencer can use its privilege to extort users through censorship or toxic MEV extraction. When there are multiple sequencers, the chain is as censorship resistant as the least censoring sequencer. Due to the complex second order effects of leader election, it is difficult to know for sure the ideal mechanism. This RFP is specifically designed to allow many possible leader election mechanisms to be expressed in smart contracts, so that teams can work on them in parallel outside of the core protocol. Then over time we can “enshrine” the mechanisms that work the best into the core protocol itself. The best mechanisms will be able to handle toxic MEV extraction and make it less of an issue for end users.\r\n\r\n## **What is required to execute this RFP?**\r\n\r\nMinor changes to many parts of the codebase is required for this RFP to be implemented fully. Ideally, this code is behind a hardfork flag so that the code can still sync existing networks. See the “What is the MVP” section above for details\r\n\r\n## **What milestones should be tracked to determine successful completion of this RFP? How should the Foundation measure progress towards this RFP?**\r\n\r\n- Derivation pipeline changes as described in “What is the MVP”\r\n- Batcher changes as described above\r\n- Optimism system smart contract changes for the system config\r\n- Batch inbox smart contract that implements round robin\r\n- Running the local devnet with multiple batchers running, both using the same op-geth\r\n\r\nThe bullet points are the general chunks of work involved in the project and can act as milestones for development. Progress towards the completion of this RFP should be based on working code where working is defined as not production ready (not optimized, no metrics, not audited or thoroughly tested) but operating as expected based on enough test coverage to see it working and a final deliverable of a demo on the local devnet where it is obvious that multiple batchers are working in parallel.\r\n\r\n## **How should the community measure impact upon completion of this RFP?**\r\n\r\nThe community should measure impact of this RFP based on it removing one of the centralization bottlenecks from the system. The system is as centralized as the most centralized aspect. The lack of fault proofs is the most centralized aspect (a single party can rug the network) so we are working on that, but the lack of leader election will be the most centralized aspect of the system after fault proofs ship. \r\n\r\nThis also opens up the design space for people to experiment with leader election mechanisms, which will be very fun. We can imagine some experiments but guarantee people will come up with stuff we never imagined.\r\n\r\n## Application instructions\r\n\r\n_To apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread below.

The Optimism Monorepo enforces a [style guide](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock#standards-and-conventions) for its smart contracts. Currently, this style guide is largely enforced by PR review, a process that does not scale as external contributors begin to contribute additional smart contracts.\r\n\r\nThe Optimism Monorepo is looking for a Solidity style linter that can enforce the style guide programmatically rather than via PR review. Please refer to the [style guide](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock#standards-and-conventions) for an exact list of conventions currently in use.\r\n\r\n## Potential Features\r\n\r\n- Support the Optimism Monorepo [Solidity style guide](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock#standards-and-conventions)\r\n- Throw an error when the style guide is not enforced and explain where the issue comes from\r\n- Create a CI task that will run the linter in CI\r\n- Bonus points, provide a `--fix` option to automatically fix style issues\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nProgrammatically checking the style guide will significantly simplify the process of contributing to the monorepo. Engineering time will no longer have to be spent reviewing style nits, which will speed things up while also reducing headaches for external contributors. Win win!",

    "body": "## Foundation Mission (RFP) – OP Stack Zero Knowledge Proof\n_To take on this project, submit a proposal to this thread by June 28. Read more about Missions [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881)._\n\n* **S4 Intent**: Technical Decentralization\n* **Foundation Mission (RFP):** Implement a zero knowledge proof which can prove Optimism’s [fault proof program](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/fault-proof.md#fault-proof-program) through an [instruction set architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) supported by the [golang compiler](https://gist.github.com/mcandre/b78112ed46f2360ddc59f33a78951d0e)\n* **Proposal Tier:**  [Fledgling](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877) \n* **Baseline grant amount**: 250k OP\n* **Accepting one or multiple proposals:** Multiple \n* **OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Sponsor**: Kelvin (@smartcontracts)\n* **Submit by**: June 28th at 19:00 GMT\n* **Selection by**: July 13th at 19:00 GMT\n\n### **How will this Foundation Mission (RFP) will help accomplish the above Intent?**\n\nImplementing a zero knowledge proof (ZKP) for OP Chains is a prerequisite to enable secure and low latency cross chain communication between L2 and L1, as well as directly between OP Chains. A ZKP for a well-supported instruction set architecture (ISA) that can prove the Optimism [fault proof program](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/fault-proof.md#fault-proof-program) acts as the foundation for a system that can prove any OP Stack based blockchain.\n\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\n\nCompleting this mission means implementing a zero knowledge proof (ZKP) system that can prove the Optimism [fault proof program](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/fault-proof.md#fault-proof-program) using an instruction set architecture (ISA) supported by the golang compiler such as MIPS, RISC-V, or WASM. This proof system must additionally be shown to work in practice by proving the state transition between two blocks for a standard configuration OP Stack chain.\n\nSupport for the fault proof program introduces additional requirements on top of proving a standard execution trace for an ISA. Specifically, the fault proof program introduces the notion of the [preimage oracle](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/fault-proof.md#pre-image-oracle) which uses special [system calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call) to load external data into the program. Every [fault proof vm](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/fault-proof.md#fault-proof-vm) is responsible for implementing some mechanism by which the hash of some data is placed at a particular location in memory, a syscall is executed, and the preimage for that hash is then loaded into memory for the program to utilize. The preimage oracle is also used to bootstrap the program with initial inputs. Please refer to the [preimage oracle section of the fault proof program documentation](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/fault-proof.md#pre-image-oracle) for further information.\n\nFor this Mission, the Optimism Foundation will accept up to three submissions. Multiple parallel attempts at creating an OP Stack ZKP will increase chances of success and provide some friendly competition for building the best OP Stack ZKP.\n\nDue to the wide design space, each solution will be evaluated based upon a few Solution Criteria. Due to the scope of this project, this RFP is not expected to be completed within governance Season 4 (June through September). Specific timelines will be discussed with each team that makes a submission.\n\nThe target grant payout for each submission will be 250k OP. Teams should discuss the solution criteria below with the Foundation, and may arrive at a different mutually agreeable grant amount dependent on the scope of their work.\n\n### **Solution Criteria:**\n\n1. **Performance** — What is the compute cost to generate and verify the proof?\n2. **Latency** — How long does the proof take to generate?\n3. **Complexity** — How many lines of code is the prover / verifier?\n4. **Robustness** — How confident are we that there are no bugs?\n5. **Security** — What are the assumptions the system relies on for its security guarantees? (e.g. trusted setup)\n6. **OP Stack Compatibility** — Are there fundamental changes required to the OP Stack?\n    1. ********Note 1********: It may be the case that small changes to the OP Stack are required to achieve an acceptable performance benchmark. One example of this includes introducing a ZKP-friendly batch submission accumulator to reduce the cost of proving transaction inclusion in the OP Chain. However, the fewer changes the better.\n    2. ********Note 2:******** The current OP Stack state transition function is defined in the fault proof program. Changes are evaluated with respect to this state transition function.\n\nProposals should include their target architecture and explicitly call out any tradeoffs their approach may have. Multiple proposals which select different tradeoffs may be accepted as each one can have their uses and bring value to the ecosystem.\n\n### **How should the Foundation measure progress towards this Foundation Mission (RFP)?** \n\nProgress can be measured based upon the completion of the following milestones:\n\n1. **Specification**: A specification for the ZKP design. Should include the criteria which the implementation will aim to satisfy.\n2. **PoC Check-in**: A demo of the ZKP being used to prove the OP Stack state transition. The specifics of the PoC are left up to the builder, but the idea is show off the viability of the concept.\n3. Executable demo proving the OP Stack state transition between two blocks: An implementation of the ZKP working end to end and integrated with a live OP Stack chain. This should include instructions which allow anyone to test the proving system themselves.\n\nThese milestones mark the completion of the proposal. \n\nOnce the proposal has been completed, a final major milestone is the adoption of the ZKP by Optimism Governance. At this point the ZKP may be voted in as a default option in the Superchain bridge, making it a core component of the OP Stack. This is outside of the scope of this proposal but is included here to illustrate the critical importance of this Mission and the massive impact these proofs may have.\n\n## **How should RetroPGF badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\n\n- Total number of token bridges using this proof system\n- Open-source ZKP research shared with the broader community making it easier for future ZKP builders\n- Fees collected by provers for their proving services\n\n## Application instructions\n\n_To apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread below.

Certain elements of governance process, including the ability to “endorse” proposals to go to vote, are endowed to delegates with voting power equal to or above 0.25% of total votable supply of OP. \r\n\r\nToday, the number of delegates who have above 0.25% votable supply is tracked on a Dune dashboard, and appropriate Discord or forum permissions are granted manually. This process is both inefficient and centralized. \r\n\r\nInstead of this manual process, the Collective should move to a record of >0.25% delegates that is onchain and consumable by the various community platforms that the Collective uses. This will help make delegate recognition more accurate, improving governance accessibility for proposers seeking delegate approvals and allowing all qualifying delegates to receive tagged notifications in Discord. It will also be less dependent on any one Optimist to maintain or update. \r\n\r\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nA completed Mission includes the following outcomes:\r\n\r\n- Issue an attestation for each delegate address with ≥ 0.25% of votable supply of OP using Optimism’s AttestationStation\r\n- Regularly poll registered delegates to monitor fluctuations in voting power. Revoke the attestation of any delegate who has fallen below 0.25%, and/or issue new attestations where necessary.\r\n- Delegates who receive this attestation should automatically get added to Attestation gated channels using [[Guild.xyz](http://guild.xyz/)](http://Guild.xyz)’s Attestation gated channel feature. This should happen automatically when Attestations get added or removed.\r\n- Code must be MIT licensed and open source.\r\n\r\n### **What milestones will help the Collective track progress towards completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n1. Specification for implementation, design approach, and architecture for the functionality listed above. \r\n2. Monthly progress updates on design and/or implementation.\r\n3. Open-source code repository to observe progress over time. \r\n\r\n### **How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n- Governance community platforms (like Discord and Discourse) are able to consume an accurate, regularly updated source of data to understand which delegates have >0.25% voting power.\r\n- Fewer errors, inconsistencies, or delays in updating community platforms to reflect current accurate delegate information.\r\n- Improvement in proposer experience due to improved visibility into which delegates are able to provide approvals on proposal drafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Application instructions\r\n\r\n_To apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread.

Draft Project Ideas may be converted into Ecosystem Project Ideas as they are explored further and more thoroughly specified.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nTransaction fees on L2 are highly variable due to L1 gas price volatility. For instance, before EIP-4844, about 99% of a user's transaction fee on OP Mainnet comes from L1 data costs. Some L2s build a system of fee smoothing natively into the protocol (e.g., Arbitrum). \r\n\r\nAlthough native fee smoothing is an excellent addition to any L2, we could further improve the user experience by creating a consumer product that provides a \"smoothed\" fee experience. In this system, the product could use some combination of membership fees, gas price derivatives, and identity/reputation (or other things) to allow users to get predictable fees. In essence, the provider of the product is responsible for hedging on behalf of users in exchange for a fee, where users are trading off slightly more expensive transactions for predictability. \r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Address opts-in to a service that provides a smoothed gas fee option\r\n- Address may pay a membership fee, opt-in via token, or some reputation/identity model, etc.\r\n- Could be similar to Amazon Prime, Movie Pass, real-world commodity markets\r\n- Smoothing provider can trade gas price derivatives to try to be profitable\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Better consumer user experience since gas fees are predictable\r\n- Creates a new playground of DeFi innovation around gas price derivatives",

Most major EVM wallets were not designed with the multi-chain world in mind and still treat L2s as second-class citizens.\r\n\r\nWe need a Superchain frontend that can be enabled for any OP Chain within the Superchain as soon as it's deployed.

Mad Science Project Ideas make great hackathon projects and tend to be a great way to explore Optimism, OP Mainnet, and the OP Stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) makes it possible to trigger actions on L2 based on things that happen on L1. One powerful mechanism that an OP Stack chain could introduce is the ability to register \"hooks\" that are automatically triggered when certain events are emitted on the L1 chain. Doing so would require modifying the derivation layer of the OP Stack in a manner similar to the [example modification](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/tutorials/add-attr/) found within the OP Stack documentation.\r\n\r\nAn ideal hook system would allow any address to register a hook via a smart contract on L2 by providing the L1 address, an event filter, and a function to be triggered whenever the event is emitted. You may have to come up with a fee mechanism that accounts for the cost of checking for events each time a new block is introduced. It may also be necessary to supply a maximum number of hooks that can be registered at any point.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Allow users to register new hooks with an L2 smart contracts\r\n- Modify the derivation layer to trigger L2 contracts based on the registered hooks\r\n- Charge a fee whenever a hook is checked\r\n- Charge a fee whenever a hook is executed (to pay for gas)\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n- [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/)\r\n- [Derivation layer modification example](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/tutorials/add-attr/)",

Consider using the mechanism introduced by [Ticking Optimism](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/featured/#ticking-optimism) to create an OP Stack chain that automatically triggers an update function whenever a new L2 block is produced. This would make the simulation update in real time without the need for transactions to update the simulation state.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Allow users to spin up their own Game of Life system on chain\r\n- Allow users to initialize the Game of Life board with a starting state\r\n- Allow users to start the simulation by sending a transaction\r\n- Allow users to see the simulation progress with each tick\r\n- Allow users to pause the simulation or reset it to start over",

    "body": "**What is a Draft Project Idea?**\r\n\r\nA Draft Project Idea is a concept for a project within the Optimism ecosystem that is generally considered valuable but has not yet been fleshed out into a clearly defined product. Draft Project Ideas may be converted into Ecosystem Project Ideas as they are explored further and more thoroughly specified.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nA fault proof is a mechanism that proves that a given program with some agreed-upon starting state and agreed-upon inputs did not generate some proposed output. Combined with an optimistic output proposal mechanism, fault proofs are an effective way of scaling the computational abilities of a smart contract by limiting onchain interactions to only the case where a proposed output is invalid.\r\n\r\nSeveral different fault proof systems exist already and more will be developed as time goes on. In general, the overall structure of a fault proving system tends to be identical except for specific areas. We believe that these key areas can be abstracted away into modules in a larger fault proving framework that would make it possible to reuse code from across the ecosystem and reduce the amount of duplicated work.\r\n\r\nA basic model for a framework like this would contain the following components:\r\n- A \"program\" that consists of compiled bytecode for some machine architecture\r\n- A \"program executor\" that executes a program bytecode for a given machine architecture with some given state and generates an execution trace in some standardized format (follows a standard interface)\r\n- A \"dispute game\" that resolves disputes over any arbitrary array (OP Labs is already working on this)\r\n- A \"smart contract opcode executor\" that can execute any single opcode within the specified machine architecture onchain (follows a standard interface)\r\n\r\nFault proof developers then only need to implement the \"program executor\" and the \"smart contract opcode executor\" for any given machine architecture while the rest of the logic is handled by the framework. For example, it should be easy to slot in a MIPS fault proof or a RISC-V fault proof within this system without having to re-implement everything.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nA fault proof framework would have a significant impact because:\r\n- It would allow developers to more easily build proofs for new machine architectures\r\n- It would allow projects to take advantage of client diversity by targeting different architectures",

As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe [AttestationStation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/intro/) (ATST) is a central repository for attestations on OP Mainnet. The ATST is transitioning to use the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/welcome) (EAS) standard which introduces schemas that attestations can follow. EAS schemas are defined as Solidity structs and can therefore allow attestations to contain arbitrarily complex data structures.\r\n\r\nOne problem with EAS schemas today is that it's often unclear which schema a developer should use for a given type of attestation. Sometimes a schema already exists that a developer can use, sometimes no schema exists, and sometimes multiple potential schemas exist.\r\n\r\nIt's important for developers to be able to easily understand:\r\n- What schemas already exist for a given type of attestation\r\n- Which schema to use for a given type of attestation\r\n\r\nWe propose solving these problems with the introduction of a \"schema reputation system\" with the following features:\r\n- Accounts can attest that a given schema is the \"correct\" schema to use for a given task\r\n- Users can explore the list of \"correct\" schemas on a web interface\r\n- The web interface applies a default algorithm to surface \"correct\" schemas\r\n- The web interface allows users to apply alternative algorithms to surface \"correct\" schemas\r\n\r\nA simple proposal for a default algorithm would be to use attestations from reputable organizations in the space. Although this isn't totally decentralized, it provides a strong starting point. If the application is designed carefully, the default algorithm can easily be updated and improved in the future to be more decentralized. Furthermore, if the web interface allows users to include their own algorithms, then users can experiment with better mechanisms on behalf of the project.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nA schema reputation system is highly impactful because it allows developers to coordinate on standardized schemas for specific tasks. Standardized schemas means that multiple applications can work from the same dataset and can easily find attestations of a given type without fear that data will be fractured across different data structures. This system also gives developers confidence that they're using a standard that others will be able to easily parse.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n- [AttestationStation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/attestation-station/)\r\n- [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/welcome)",

Gift cards are a great way to get someone into the L2 ecosystem.\r\n\r\nFrom the [Bridge Pass Mirror post](https://d.mirror.xyz/Sjpxa2r_wxkQUGXUr8oO2PhBlyfIRgLBx2YevoXXwyY): \r\n\r\n> *What if we took the gift card metaphor to make collectible NFT editions that, when minted, automatically bridge funds to an L2?*\r\n> \r\n\r\n> Instead of bridging to L2 through a boring “swap” UX, what if users could buy a cool looking NFT! Under the hood, the purchaser receives the collectible NFT on L1, while the funds are bridged and made available on L2.\r\n>\r\n\r\nCreate a gift card NFT that contains a special note for the recipient and can be redeemed for a certain amount of ETH or OP on OP Mainnet. The gift cards could live either on L1 or on L2.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Giftcard marketplace”-like interface, with maybe just a couple of highly desired collections ([motorheadz](https://mirror.xyz/0x57D1eAE9f0972723F0e78EAF4e6C08e90565206F/AtKMzoVY1qzrvA1gal1XqJv74bpx-sg9ptv5TDw2maU)?)\r\n- Allow users to create a gift card by writing a message and attaching some ETH or OP.\r\n- Allow users to send the gift card to addresses on Ethereum or OP Mainnet.\r\n- Allow recipients to access the gift card, see the special message, and redeem the gift card for its value.\r\n- Buy an NFT, autobridge from L1 (or wherever you have funds) \r\n- If the gift card is sent on Ethereum, redeeming should perform a deposit into OP Mainnet.\r\n- If the gift card is sent on OP Mainnet, redeeming should simply transfer assets to the recipient.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- This can onboard new NFT users by just sneaking bridging under the hood.\r\n- It can be a fun way to make OP NFTs go viral — by gifting!",

It's possible to hack the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io) so that data is published to a separate data availability layer instead of being published to Ethereum. Only hashes of that data would be published to Ethereum. You could then implement a challenge game on top of this to create a full-blown plasma protocol.\r\n\r\nPlasma protocols like this are highly valuable because they provide extremely cheap data availability options while still providing good enough security properties for many use-cases. A design for a generic plasma protocol for the OP Stack would be very useful for the OP Stack ecosystem.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Post data to any data availability provider\r\n- Post hashes to Ethereum\r\n- Define a challenge game that is compatible with the OP Stack",

Everything should be represented as an attestation.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Allow organizers to register an event, and store event details onchain via attestations.\r\n- Allow organizers to issue tickets via attestations.\r\n- Allow organizers to revoke tickets via attestations.\r\n- Allow organizers to verify tickets by scanning a QR code.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Ticketing data is very useful for other applications using the AttestationStation\r\n- Crypto ticketing apps are lackluster right now and there is a strong need for better options\r\n- More people would use the AttestationStation in general",

Mad Science Project Ideas make great hackathon projects and tend to be a great way to explore Optimism, OP Mainnet, and the OP Stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n[The OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) makes it possible to easily spin up new rollups with custom execution environments. Although you could probably put [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) on a blockchain, why not create a blockchain that *is* Doom?\r\n\r\nDoom Chain would involve [hacking the execution layer](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/execution/) to replace the EVM with an emulator of some system running Doom. Transactions in the system would then represent inputs to the system. Running Doom [demo files](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Demo) should be a good test of this hack.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Be able to play Doom in a browser where each input is actually a transaction to an OP Stack chain.\r\n- Be able to run Doom [demo files](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Demo) as an automated series of transactions to the Doom Chain.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Doom is a great game\r\n- OP Stack community would learn a lot about the process of modifying the execution layer\r\n- You would get clout for SURE",

Ideally these common transaction types include basic transfers, ERC20 transfers, swaps, and a series of transaction types pulled from popular apps on OP Mainnet.\r\n- Display historical gas prices on OP Mainnet to show how gas prices have changed over time.\r\n- Display the users and applications that are using the most gas on OP Mainnet over certain specified time ranges (1d, 7d, 30d, all time).\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Users would have a better understanding of OP Mainnet fee behavior",
