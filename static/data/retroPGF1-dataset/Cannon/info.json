This will enable Optimistic Rollups to run the exact code written in Geth and even other client implementations which can compile down to MIPS. This would allow: \n1. Optimistic proofs of computation across any MIPS execution trace (truebit, already super useful);\n2. Optimistic proofs of Geth computation! This is what we need for the first generation of EVM equivalent rollups! Woot!","allocation":"$4,890"}
