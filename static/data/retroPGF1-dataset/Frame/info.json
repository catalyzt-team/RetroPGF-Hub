{"name":"Frame","website":"https://frame.sh/","lead_name":"Jordan Muir","email":"jordan@frame.sh","question_1":"The Frame team (of just 2 people!) is building a fantastic product, which I think might even become superior to Metamask one day. It's not quite there yet because the team is self-funded, and is operating with marginal resources. I believe that the industry needs some serious competition to Metamask, as a healthy thing, to become more robust, and to accelerate the UX space development as a whole. Frame just needs a little push from the community to take their game to the next level!","allocation":"$18,337"}
