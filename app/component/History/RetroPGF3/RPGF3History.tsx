          RetroPGF Rounds 1 & 2 were a resounding success, benefitting numerous
          dedicated individuals and teams who are passionate about creating
          public goods. These retroactive grants have not only made a
          significant impact on their projects but have also reinforced their
          commitment to the Optimism ecosystem. At the heart of the Optimism
          Collective's mission is the belief that those who contribute to public
          goods should be rewarded for their efforts. RetroPGF is like a
          refreshing twist on the traditional market economy, specifically
          designed to champion public goods. And the best part? It's already
          proving to be a game-changer for many builders within the Collective.
          RetroPGF, in essence, serves as Optimism's vehicle for nurturing the
          development of a free, open, and decentralized internet that puts the
          power and value back into the hands of those who create and maintain
          it.
